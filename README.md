band-aid
------------

band-aid is a fully responsive website that allows you to find all the information you want to know, about the artists you care about: right as you listen to them.


There are currently several bugs. Your patience is appreciated.

Limitations/Known bugs
=============

1. musixmatch API requires minimum $25,000 for full access, which I don't have. The lyrics therefore cannot be posted in full.
2. Lyrics aren't looping through and posting correctly. I *think* I have a solution to this, but I'm not sure. If you have a suggestion, let me know!
3. I'm a terrible amateur coder and if you're a professional, my code might actually make you cry.
4. Searching celebrities who aren't songwriters still pulls up some results. ?????
5. musixmatch demo API limitations means lyrics are limited to 500 returns a day. If you aren't getting lyrics, this might be why (console/Firebug will display a 401 error).


Future features
============
1. List of upcoming concerts for artist
2. Working lyrics
3. CSS upgrade/general clean-up
